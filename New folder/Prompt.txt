Design a futuristic, immersive, and premium portfolio website for a skilled developer.
The visual aesthetic must reflect the style, colors, glow, and modern elegance of the attached image named reference.

Use cutting-edge tools:

GSAP for powerful animation

Locomotive Scroll for smooth parallax scrolling

Spline for 3D integration in the hero section

Site must be fully responsive across all devices.

üîÑ GSAP Loading Animation & Progress Bar (New)
Add a modern, cinematic loading animation before the main content appears:

Fullscreen preloader screen with a centered animated logo or text (e.g., "Milad")

Include a progress bar that fills from 0% to 100% using GSAP

After loading completes:

Progress bar fades out

Preloader scales and fades away

Main content fades in with smooth transitions

Example animation flow (GSAP):
js
Copy
Edit
gsap.to(".progress-bar", {
  width: "100%",
  duration: 2,
  ease: "power2.out",
  onComplete: () => {
    gsap.to(".preloader", {
      opacity: 0,
      scale: 0.9,
      duration: 1,
      onComplete: () => {
        document.querySelector(".preloader").style.display = "none";
      }
    });
  }
});
The loading sequence should set the tone: techy, smooth, and premium.
